<h2>üë®‚Äçüíª Systems Administration / Desktop Support Labs:</h2>

<strong> Multi-OS Hypervisor Setup </strong>

- Configured a virtualization environment using Proxmox to run multiple operating systems concurrently, including Windows 10, Windows 11, Ubuntu, Fedora and RHEL.

- Employed standardized networking protocols and configurations to interconnect these OS instances within an internal network. 

- Established seamless communication and data exchange among the OSs, replicating collaboration and resource sharing. Proficiently implemented firewall rules, VLANs, or other networking techniques to ensure security and optimize performance within the virtualized environment.

<strong> Automated Network Printer Assignment via AD-based GPOs </strong>

- Engineered and implemented a dynamic solution utilizing Windows Group Policy Objects (GPOs) to automate network printer assignments for users based on their Active Directory (AD) object locations.

- Designed and deployed customized GPOs, leveraging AD organizational structure to seamlessly assign network printer objects to users upon login, optimizing printing workflows and enhancing user productivity. 

- Conducted thorough testing and validation to ensure accurate and efficient printer mappings across diverse AD organizational units (OUs) and user groups. Documented the process and provided comprehensive user guides for seamless future maintenance and scalability.

<strong> Active Directory Domain Establishment and PowerShell User/Group Management </strong>

- Established a robust Active Directory (AD) domain infrastructure utilizing Server Manager, configuring core domain services and policies to ensure a secure and efficient network environment.

- Implemented PowerShell scripting to automate user and group creation processes within the AD, optimizing administrative workflows and ensuring consistent naming conventions and security settings. Rigorously tested the domain functionality by seamlessly joining desktop systems to the domain controller using PowerShell-generated Windows profiles. 

- Validated user access to designated resources provisioned via security groups, confirming precise access control and streamlined resource allocation based on defined permissions. 

- Developed comprehensive documentation outlining the domain setup, user provisioning procedures, and group-based resource access for future reference and scalability.

<h2> Networking / CCNA Labs:üîå</h2>

<br/><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKpTEjCHZ68"> Router Configuration and Network Setup </a>

- Configured a new router, establishing it as the gateway, utilizing Console Terminal (PC-PT) for network administration tasks.
- Set the hostname to "RanetA" for identification within the network.
- Implemented security measures by setting up enable secret, console, and telnet passwords.
- Configured interface Fastethernet 0/0 to the designated network address.
- Assigned interface Fastethernet 0/1 to a specified network address range.
- Enabled both Fastethernet 0/0 and 0/1 interfaces to facilitate network connectivity.
- Conducted comprehensive testing to ensure network functionality, including ICMP pinging and Telnet connectivity validation between Ranet PC and RanetA router.

<h2> Azure Cloud ‚òÅ Labs: </h2>

<strong> Azure Cloud Infrastructure Setup and Virtual Machine Deployment </strong>

- Orchestrated the setup of an Azure tenant, establishing a robust subscription and tenant structure to facilitate cloud-based operations.
- Strategically created a Windows 10 Pro Virtual Machine and an Ubuntu Linux Virtual Machine within the EAST US 2 region, optimizing for cost-effective yet efficient configurations.
- Configured the Resource Group ("RG-Cyber-Lab") and Virtual Network ("Lab-VNet") to streamline resource management and network connectivity for both VM instances.
- Carefully tailored network security by implementing Network Security Groups (NSGs) for inbound traffic, deploying Layer 4 firewalls to allow comprehensive traffic management and ensure secure communication.
- Methodically documented the Azure subscription details, VM configurations, and network security settings for ongoing reference and management.

<strong> Windows Server Configuration and SQL Server Installation for Vulnerability Testing </strong>

- Configured a Windows-based Virtual Machine within an Azure environment for vulnerability testing and SQL Server deployment. 
- Disabled Windows Firewall to simulate an open environment for testing purposes. Installed SQL Server Evaluation, adopting default login credentials and SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), enhancing database management capabilities.
- Enabled SQL logging for integration with Windows Event Viewer, ensuring comprehensive monitoring and diagnostic capabilities.
- Conducted connectivity tests by pinging and establishing SSH login to the Ubuntu-based Virtual Machine ("linux-vm"), validating cross-platform interaction within the cloud-based environment.

<strong> Log Analytics Workspace and Azure Sentinel Integration </strong>

- Created a Log Analytics Workspace named LAW-Cyber-Lab-0x, serving as the central log aggregator for data analysis and monitoring.
- Configured Azure Sentinel and established a connection with the Log Analytics Workspace for seamless data ingestion and analysis.
- Set up a geoip watchlist within Azure Sentinel, utilizing a local file as the data source containing approximately 27,000 records.
- Specified watchlist parameters including Name/Alias (geoip), Source type (Local File), and Search Key (network).
- Monitored the upload and synchronization process to ensure successful data transfer into the Log Analytics Workspace.
- Verified data integration by querying _GetWatchlist("geoip") within the Log Analytics Workspace, confirming proper data retrieval and utilization within Azure Sentinel for enhanced threat detection and cybersecurity monitoring.
