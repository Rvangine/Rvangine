- Set host names for router and switch using the 'host name' command in global configuration mode.
- Implement an unencrypted 'enable password' (CCNA) for privileged exec mode access.
- Test the new enable password by accessing privileged exec mode.
- Review the unencrypted password in the running configuration with 'show running config'.
- Activate password encryption using 'service password encryption' for security.
- Confirm password encryption by viewing passwords in the running configuration.
- Enhance security using 'enable secret' (Cisco) with MD5 encryption.
- Verify that only the 'enable secret' password allows access to privileged exec mode.
- Observe both encrypted passwords in running configuration to ensure effective encryption.
- Save configuration changes from running to startup configuration.

- Configured R1's hostname for identification and management.
- Viewed R1's interfaces, IP addresses, status, etc., using a relevant 'show' command.
- Assigned and enable IP addresses on R1's interfaces with provided IPv4 address and subnetmasks, adding appropriate interface descriptions.
- Verified R1's interface configurations with a 'show' command post-configuration.
- Checked the running config to confirm changes, and save the configuration.
- Set up IP addresses for PC1, PC2, and PC3.
- Tested connectivity by pinging from PC1 to PC2 and PC3.

- Configured a new router, establishing it as the gateway, utilizing Console Terminal (PC-PT) for network administration tasks.
- Set the hostname to "RanetA" for identification within the network.
- Implemented security measures by setting up enable secret, console, and telnet passwords.
- Configured interface Fastethernet 0/0 to the designated network address.
- Assigned interface Fastethernet 0/1 to a specified network address range.
- Enabled both Fastethernet 0/0 and 0/1 interfaces to facilitate network connectivity.
- Conducted comprehensive testing to ensure network functionality, including ICMP pinging and Telnet connectivity validation between Ranet PC and RanetA router.
